## Implementation Steps
### Phase 1: Validation (Pre-Production)
```powershell
# Run validation suite
.\Test-CodebaseIntegrity.ps1
.\Test-FinalHealthCheck.ps1
.\Test-PolicyCompliance.ps1
```
**Expected Result**: All checks must show ✅ GREEN

### Phase 2: Test Deployment
1. **Create Test OU**: `OU=Test-[PolicyName],OU=Testing,DC=domain,DC=com`
2. **Deploy to Test**:
   ```powershell
   # Deploy command here
   ```
3. **Validation Tests**:
   - [ ] Policy applies correctly
   - [ ] No errors in event logs
   - [ ] Expected restrictions work
   - [ ] No unintended side effects

### Phase 3: Pilot Deployment
1. **Target**: [5-10% of affected users]
2. **Duration**: [24-48 hours]
3. **Monitoring**:
   - [ ] User feedback collected
   - [ ] Help desk tickets monitored
   - [ ] System performance normal

### Phase 4: Production Deployment
1. **Deployment Command**:
   ```powershell
   # Production deployment command
   ```
2. **Verification**:
   ```powershell
   # Verification commands
   ```

## Rollback Procedures
### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)
```powershell
# Step 1: Unlink GPO
Remove-GPLink -Name "[Policy Name]" -Target "[Target OU]"

# Step 2: Force policy refresh
Invoke-GPUpdate -Computer "[Target]" -Force

# Step 3: Verify removal
Get-GPOReport -Name "[Policy Name]" -ReportType Html -Path ".\rollback-report.html"
```

### Full Rollback (Complete Restoration)
```powershell
# Restore from backup
Restore-GPO -Name "[Policy Name]" -Path ".\Backups\[BackupID]"
```

## Success Criteria
### Technical Success
- ✅ All validation scripts pass post-deployment
- ✅ No increase in help desk tickets
- ✅ No critical errors in event logs
- ✅ Policy applies to 100% of target objects

### Business Success
- ✅ [Specific business metric achieved]
- ✅ User productivity maintained
- ✅ Security posture improved

## Monitoring Plan
### Day 1-7: Active Monitoring
- Check event logs every 4 hours
- Monitor help desk queue
- Review gpresult reports
- Track login success rates

### Week 2-4: Passive Monitoring
- Weekly validation runs
- Monthly compliance reports
- Quarterly security review

## Communication Plan
### Pre-Deployment
- **T-7 days**: Initial notification to affected users
- **T-3 days**: Reminder with specifics
- **T-1 day**: Final reminder

### Post-Deployment
- **T+1 hour**: Deployment confirmation
- **T+1 day**: Status update
- **T+1 week**: Lessons learned
