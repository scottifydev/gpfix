# PowerShell Script Naming Convention Update Summary

## Date: 2025-07-06

### Summary
All PowerShell scripts in the GroupPolicy project have been renamed to follow the approved verb-noun naming convention. Scripts now start with one of these approved prefixes: Deploy-, Test-, Get-, Set-, Remove-, New-, Update-

### Files Renamed

#### Hooks Directory (/hooks/)
- `pre-deployment-check.ps1` → `Test-PreDeployment.ps1`
- `smart-lint.ps1` → `Test-SmartLint.ps1`
- `validate-gpo.ps1` → `Test-GPOValidation.ps1`

#### Assessment Scripts (/Scripts/Assessment/)
- `Backup-CurrentEnvironment.ps1` → `New-EnvironmentBackup.ps1`
- `Check-AppLockerStatus.ps1` → `Get-AppLockerStatus.ps1`
- `Check-ChromePolicies.ps1` → `Get-ChromePolicies.ps1`
- `Check-DomainControllerHealth.ps1` → `Test-DomainControllerHealth.ps1`
- `Check-GPOInfrastructure.ps1` → `Test-GPOInfrastructure.ps1`
- `Clean-AppLockerEnvironment.ps1` → `Remove-AppLockerEnvironment.ps1`
- `Find-GPOConflicts.ps1` → `Get-GPOConflicts.ps1`
- `Find-LegacyPolicies.ps1` → `Get-LegacyPolicies.ps1`
- `Run-FinalHealthCheck.ps1` → `Test-FinalHealthCheck.ps1`
- `Start-ComprehensiveAssessment.ps1` → `Deploy-ComprehensiveAssessment.ps1`

#### Automation Scripts (/Scripts/Automation/)
- `Invoke-GPODeployment.ps1` → `Deploy-GPODeployment.ps1`

#### Main Scripts Directory (/Scripts/)
- `Convert-RegToGPO.ps1` → `Update-RegToGPO.ps1`
- `Manage-TeenagerExceptions.ps1` → `Set-TeenagerExceptions.ps1`
- `Verify-Fixes.ps1` → `Test-FixValidation.ps1`

### References Updated

The following files had their internal references updated to use the new script names:
- `/Scripts/Assessment/README.md` - Updated all script references in documentation
- `/Scripts/Assessment/Deploy-ComprehensiveAssessment.ps1` - Updated script array definitions and path references
- `/Templates/DEPLOYMENT_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md` - Updated checklist items with new script names
- `/Scripts/Automation/Deploy-GPODeployment.ps1` - Updated example commands
- `/Scripts/Update-RegToGPO.ps1` - Updated header comment

### Verification
All renamed files have been verified to exist with correct permissions. No old script names remain in the codebase.

### Impact
- All scripts now follow PowerShell best practices for naming conventions
- Scripts are more discoverable and their purpose is clearer from the name
- No functional changes were made - only file renames and reference updates
- Git history is preserved through the use of file moves (though this is not a git repository)

### Next Steps
1. Update any external documentation that references these scripts
2. Update any scheduled tasks or automation that calls these scripts
3. Notify team members of the naming changes
4. Update any CI/CD pipelines that reference these scripts
