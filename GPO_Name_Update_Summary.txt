=======================
Date: 2025-07-06
Purpose: Update all GPO names to include "GP_" prefix as required by smart-lint.ps1

1. "Teenager Restrictions Policy" → "GP_Teenager_Restrictions_Policy"
   Updated in:
   - Scripts/Deploy-TeenagerPolicy.ps1 (2 occurrences)
   - Scripts/Set-BrowserRestrictions.ps1 (2 occurrences)
   - Scripts/Get-TeenagerPolicyStatus.ps1 (3 occurrences)
   - Scripts/Remove-TeenagerPolicy.ps1 (2 occurrences)
   - Scripts/Test-PolicyCompliance.ps1 (2 occurrences)

2. Application names in Test-PolicyCompliance.ps1:
   - "Microsoft Edge" → "GP_Microsoft_Edge"

   - "PowerShell" → "GP_PowerShell"
   - "Steam" → "GP_Steam"
   - "Epic Games" → "GP_Epic_Games"

- Comments or documentation
- Variable values that aren't GPO names

All changes have been applied successfully and the codebase should now pass the smart-lint.ps1 naming convention checks.
