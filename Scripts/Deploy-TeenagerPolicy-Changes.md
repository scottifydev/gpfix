# Deploy-TeenagerPolicy.ps1 - Fix Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Added Validation Integration
- Added Test-CodebaseIntegrity.ps1 call at the beginning (after parameter block)
- Script now validates the codebase before proceeding with deployment
- Exit code 2 is used for validation failures

### 2. Added Backup Creation
- Backup is now created BEFORE any GPO modifications (new Step 2)
- Backup path is initialized early in the script
- Existing GPOs are backed up before modifications

### 3. Removed Hardcoded Domain
- Domain "scottify.io" is no longer hardcoded
- DomainName is now a mandatory parameter with ValidateScript
- ValidateScript checks if the domain exists and is accessible
- All domain references now use the $DomainName parameter
- OUPath is constructed dynamically if not provided

### 4. Added Try-Catch Blocks for AD Operations
- All AD operations now have proper try-catch blocks:
  - Get-ADGroup
  - New-ADGroup
  - Get-ADOrganizationalUnit
  - Get-ADDomain
- Each catch block provides specific error messages

### 5. Fixed Undefined $backupPath Variable
- $backupPath is now initialized early in the script
- Rollback script correctly references the backup path
- Rollback script is saved to the backup directory

### 6. Changed Exit Codes
- All validation failures now use exit code 2
- Script failures use exit code 2 (not 1)
- Success remains exit code 0

### 7. Added ValidateNotNullOrEmpty
- All string parameters (except OUPath) have [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
- DomainName has additional ValidateScript for domain validation
- OUPath is optional and constructed dynamically if not provided

## Workflow Implementation
The script now follows the Research → Plan → Implement → Validate → Deploy workflow:
1. **Validate** - Test-CodebaseIntegrity.ps1 runs first
2. **Research** - Checks existing groups, GPOs, and OUs
3. **Plan** - Creates backup before modifications
4. **Implement** - Creates/modifies GPOs and AD objects
5. **Deploy** - Links GPO to OU and generates reports

## Key Improvements
- Better error handling throughout
- No hardcoded values
- Proper backup and rollback capabilities
- Validation before deployment
- Dynamic domain handling
