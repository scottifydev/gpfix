# Application Control Policy for Teenagers

## Purpose and Scope

This policy implements application whitelisting using Windows AppLocker to restrict which applications teenagers can execute on managed systems. The policy is designed to provide a secure computing environment while allowing access to approved gaming platforms and educational software.

### Key Features
- Whitelists Windows system executables and Program Files
- Explicitly allows Steam and Epic Games platforms
- Blocks execution of all unauthorized applications
- Prevents script execution outside of Windows directories
- Audit mode for Windows Installer and Packaged Apps

## Security Implications

### Strengths
- **Application Whitelisting**: Only explicitly allowed applications can run, providing strong protection against malware and unauthorized software
- **Publisher-based Rules**: Uses digital signatures for Steam and Epic Games, preventing spoofing
- **Script Control**: Blocks unauthorized scripts while allowing system scripts
- **Defense in Depth**: Combines path rules with publisher rules for redundancy

### Considerations
- Users cannot install or run new applications without policy modification
- Some legitimate applications may be blocked if not properly whitelisted
- Updates to allowed applications are permitted due to version wildcards
- Audit mode for installers allows monitoring before full enforcement

### Potential Vulnerabilities
- Applications in %PROGRAMFILES% are allowed, which could be exploited if write access is obtained
- Windows directory exceptions (Temp, Tasks, Tracing) need monitoring
- Living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) in Windows directory could be misused

## Target Audience

This policy is specifically designed for:
- **Teenagers (13-17 years)**: Provides controlled access to gaming and educational software
- **Managed Home Environments**: Parents/guardians managing family computers
- **Educational Institutions**: Schools implementing restricted computer access
- **Youth Centers**: Public access computers for minors

## Testing Procedures

### Pre-Deployment Testing

1. **Test Environment Setup**
   ```powershell
   # Create a test OU for policy testing
   New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name "Test-Teenagers-AppLocker" -Path "DC=domain,DC=com"
   
   # Apply policy to test computers
   New-GPLink -Name "Application-Control-Teenagers-Policy" -Target "OU=Test-Teenagers-AppLocker,DC=domain,DC=com"
   ```

2. **Functionality Testing**
   - Verify Windows applications launch correctly
   - Test Steam client installation and game launches
   - Test Epic Games launcher and Fortnite
   - Attempt to run unauthorized executables (should be blocked)
   - Verify script blocking outside Windows directory

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Monitor system performance during policy application
   - Check AppLocker service resource usage
   - Verify no delays in authorized application launches

4. **Logging and Monitoring**
   ```powershell
   # Enable AppLocker auditing
   auditpol /set /subcategory:"Application Generated" /success:enable /failure:enable
   
   # Check AppLocker events
   Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-AppLocker/EXE and DLL" | Select-Object -First 20
   ```

### User Acceptance Testing

1. Have test users perform typical tasks:
   - Launch allowed games
   - Use Windows built-in applications
   - Attempt to install new software (should fail gracefully)

2. Document any legitimate use cases that are blocked

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback

1. **Disable Policy Link**
   ```powershell
   # Disable the GPO link immediately
   Set-GPLink -Name "Application-Control-Teenagers-Policy" -Target "OU=Teenagers,DC=domain,DC=com" -LinkEnabled No
   
   # Force policy update
   Invoke-GPUpdate -Force -Computer "TargetComputer"
   ```

2. **Emergency Bypass**
   ```powershell
   # Stop AppLocker service on affected computer
   Stop-Service -Name AppIDSvc -Force
   Set-Service -Name AppIDSvc -StartupType Disabled
   ```

### Gradual Rollback

1. **Switch to Audit Mode**
   - Change enforcement mode from "Enabled" to "AuditOnly" for each rule collection
   - Monitor logs for policy violations that would have occurred
   - Address issues before re-enabling enforcement

2. **Selective Rule Modification**
   - Add specific executables to whitelist as needed
   - Create publisher rules for newly approved applications
   - Test changes on subset of computers first

### Post-Rollback Actions

1. **Document Issues**
   - Record all applications that caused policy violations
   - Note user complaints and business impact
   - Create action plan for policy refinement

2. **Policy Refinement**
   ```xml
   <!-- Add new allowed application example -->
   <FilePublisherRule Id="new-rule-id" Name="Allow New Application" 
                      Description="Added after rollback" 
                      UserOrGroupSid="S-1-1-0" Action="Allow">
     <Conditions>
       <FilePublisherCondition PublisherName="O=COMPANY,L=CITY,S=STATE,C=US" 
                               ProductName="*" BinaryName="*">
         <BinaryVersionRange LowSection="*" HighSection="*" />
       </FilePublisherCondition>
     </Conditions>
   </FilePublisherRule>
   ```

3. **Gradual Re-deployment**
   - Apply refined policy to test group
   - Monitor for 1-2 weeks
   - Expand deployment in phases

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly: Review blocked application logs
- Quarterly: Update allowed application list
- Annually: Full policy audit and optimization

### Adding New Applications
1. Obtain publisher information using PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   Get-AppLockerFileInformation -Path "C:\Path\To\Application.exe" | Format-List
   ```

2. Create appropriate rule (publisher-based preferred)
3. Test in isolated environment
4. Deploy to production

### Monitoring Commands
```powershell
# Check policy application status
Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective -Xml | Format-List

# Export current policy for backup
Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective -Xml | Out-File "AppLocker-Backup-$(Get-Date -Format yyyyMMdd).xml"

# Test specific executable against policy
Test-AppLockerPolicy -Path "C:\Path\To\File.exe" -User domain\teenager
```
